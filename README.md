# Stress_classifier
### Classifier for stressed people identification.  
In this script there are all of the steps I have made to prepare the solution. The code is splited into several sections:

- Data Import and preparation
- Division into subsets and preparation for classification
- Classification tree
- KNN
- Logistic regression
- Neural Network
- SVM
- Random forest
- Ensemble classificator  
The most effective in terms of F1 measure is the last one - Ensemble classificator. So, it would be the main algorithm for further work.
